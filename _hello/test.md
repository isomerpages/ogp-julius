&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<label for="accordion7">6. Full Subject Based Banding (FSBB) and Subject Based Banding (SBB)</label>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<div>

<p> Zhenghua Secondary School is one of the 28 pilot schools for Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB).<br><br>

<b>Background</b><br><br>

Zhenghua Secondary School has since 2017 been offering subject-based banding in English, Mother-Tongue Languages, Math and Science for eligible Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical) students.<br><br>

To provide an even more customised secondary education experience for students, we have rolled out Full SBB to all Sec 1 students from 2021. Full SBB will provide students with opportunities to study even more subjects at a level better suited to their strengths and interests.<br><br>

As part of this pilot, our school will:<br><br>

1.  Provide Secondary 2 Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical) students with the opportunity to offer Humanities subjects at a more demanding level; and<br>
2.  Organise Secondary 1 form classes in new ways.<br>

<b>Offering of Humanities subjects at a more demanding level from Secondary 2</b><br><br>

Secondary 1 Normal (Academic) students promoted to Secondary 2 Normal (Academic) can take Humanities at the Express level in Secondary 2 if he or she has met the criteria of 75% or higher in the specific Humanities subject (Geography, History, Literature in English).&nbsp; Secondary 1 Normal (Technical) students can take Geography at the Normal (Academic) Level if he or she has achieved 75% or higher for English Language at N(T) level, or the equivalent at N(A) level at the End of Year Examinations; and a Pass with Distinction grade for both Social Studies N(T) Performance Tasks in Semester 1 and 2.<br><br>

With this increased flexibility in customising our students’ learning experience, we better recognise their strengths and nurture their intrinsic motivation to learn.<br><br>

<b>Organising Secondary 1 form classes in new ways</b><br><br>

From 2021, we have organised Sec 1 classes to include students from the three different courses in each class. They take a set of subjects at a common level together for lower secondary Art, Character &amp; Citizenship Education, Design &amp; Technology, Food &amp; Consumer Education, Music, and Physical Education. For all other subjects, they are grouped in classes according to the level at which they offer each subject, i.e. Express, N(A) or N(T).<br><br>

This common learning experience creates a valuable setting for students to mingle, build meaningful friendships, and appreciate different perspectives.<br><br>

<b>FAQ</b><br><br>

<b>1.&nbsp;What is Full Subject-Based Banding about?</b><br><br>

With Full SBB, we are moving towards one secondary education, with many subject bands, to better meet our students’ learning needs, without labels. This is part of the broader shift in our education system to recognise the strengths and interests of our children, to help them build their confidence and develop an intrinsic motivation to learn for life in them.<br><br>

Zhenghua Secondary School has been offering subject-based banding in English, Mother-Tongue Language, Mathematics and Science since 2017 where eligible students can take these subjects at a higher level.&nbsp; From 2020, our school has been selected by MOE to be one of the 28 secondary schools to start piloting aspects of Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB).<br><br>

NA and NT students entering Sec 1 will be offered selected humanities subjects in Sec 2 if they meet the following criteria:<br><br>

*   Students in the N(A) stream can take Geography, History and/or English Literature at the Express level in Secondary 2 if they have met the criteria of 75% or higher in the specific Humanities subject. For example, to be eligible to offer Express level Geography, he or she must have obtained at least a combined score of 75% in N(A) Geography.<br><br>
*   Students in the N(T) stream can take Geography at the Normal (Academic) level in Secondary 2 if they have met the criteria of 75% or higher in English Language, and a pass with distinction for both Performance Tasks in N(T) Social Studies.<br><br>

<b>2.&nbsp; [For NA / NT students only] What is the criteria for my child to take SBB subjects from Sec 1?</b><br><br>

For students posted to the N(A) and N(T) course, they have the flexibility to take subjects at a more demanding level, if they meet the SBB-Sec eligibility criteria as follows:<br><br>

<b>3. [For NA / NT students Only] What if my child is a late-bloomer who did not qualify for SBB due to his/her PSLE results?</b><br><br>

Sec 1 students who perform well in their weighted assessments or end-of-year examinations may be offered EL/Math/Science/MTL at a higher level.<br><br>

<b>4.&nbsp; How will next year’s Sec 1 classes be organised?</b><br><br>

We will be organising Sec 1 form classes in new ways to include students from the Express, N(A) and N(T) courses in each class.<br><br>

*   They will all take a set of subjects at a common level together for lower secondary Art, Character &amp; Citizenship Education, Design &amp; Technology, Food &amp; Consumer Education, Music, and Physical Education.<br>
*   For all other subjects, they will be grouped in classes according to the&nbsp;<b>level at which they offer each subject, i.e. Exp, N(A) or N(T)</b>.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<label for="accordion8">7. Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP)</label>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<div>

<p> <b>1. What is PDLP about?</b><br><br>

MOE announced in March 2020 that we will strengthen students’ digital literacy through the launch of a National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) for our schools. This better enables our students, at different stages of their education journey, to acquire the digital skills required to navigate the digital age. As part of the NDLP, all Secondary School students will be equipped with a Personal Learning Device (PLD). &nbsp;By equipping students with their own PLD, we can:<br><br>

*   <b>Enhance Teaching and Learning</b>: PLDs harness technology for greater effectiveness in teaching and learning, enabled by teachers’ use of e-Pedagogy to provide active learning experiences for students.<br>
*   <b>Support Self-Directed and Collaborative Learning</b>: PLDs enable students to learn online according to their needs and interests, and to collaborate with each other, anytime and anywhere.<br>
*   <b>Support the Development of Digital Literacies</b>: PLDs provide an immersive environment for students to develop the dispositions, knowledge and skills to thrive in the digital environment.<br>

<b>2. How will this be implemented in Zhenghua Secondary School?</b><br><br>

In line with our school vision of preparing every student to be principled and future-ready leaders, all Sec 1 – 4s will be equipped with a PLD in 2023. Our school has chosen Chromebooks as our preferred PLD.<br><br>

<b>3. Why Chromebooks?</b><br><br>

Using ICT in teaching and learning is not new to our school and our students. We have been tapping on the Google platform for many years in our drive to prepare our students to be collaborative and self-directed learners. As such, it is only natural to continue on this platform. In addition, Chromebooks as compared to laptops tend to be lighter, and with batteries that can last longer. They are also more affordable than tablets as the Chromebooks we have chosen include the keyboard, stylus, mouse, touchscreen and dual cameras, unlike tablets which can become quite costly once we include the additional accessories.<br><br>

<b>4. How much does my child have to pay for the device?</b><br><br>

MOE will use bulk tenders to keep the PLDs affordable. MOE has also provided a one-off Edusave top-up of $200 in April 2020 to all eligible Singaporean students in primary and secondary schools, to help them purchase the devices selected by the school. This is on top of the annual Edusave contribution of $290 for secondary students. Students who do not have sufficient funds in their Edusave will need to bear some out-of-pocket expenses for the device, but this will not be a big amount as the Chromebooks with the enhanced 3 year warranty will cost less than $580. For students on financial assistance, we will provide further subsidies so that their out-of-pocket expenses is zero. This is to ensure that no student is denied the opportunity to benefit from the programme.<br><br>

Specific costs and details will be communicated to all parents in January 2023.<br><br>

<b>5. Can my child not purchase the device?</b><br><br>

Every student is required to have a device for teaching and learning purposes and is encouraged to purchase one through our school via MOE’s bulk tender. Students are encouraged to use the device model prescribed by the school, as the uniformity of systems and software would ensure a smooth learning experience for everyone. The device purchased through the school will come with the necessary warranty and insurance as well.<br><br>

Students who do not wish to purchase a device because they already have their own devices will have to check with the school to ascertain whether the specifications of their existing devices meet our school’s requirements. These existing devices must also be installed with a Device Management Application (DMA) software to manage the student’s access and usage.<br><br>

<b>6. How will the device be used by my child?</b><br><br>

The devices will be used to complement classroom teaching by promoting active learning and greater personalisation of our students’ schooling experience. Students can make use of digital tools such as calendaring and note-taking applications to enhance their personal productivity. They will also have more opportunities to connect, discuss and collaborate with their peers through online digital platforms. The device will also be used beyond the classroom for home-based and self-directed learning, so that students can benefit from a seamless learning experience in school and outside of school.<br><br>

<b>7. How will the school help my child to manage the use of the device?</b><br><br>

All PLDs will have a Device Management Application (DMA) installed. The DMA is a suite of software installed in the device to enable the school and parents to manage and monitor device usage by students. The DMA would restrict the type of applications and websites accessible by students and limit the students’ screen time. For example, inappropriate websites with adult or extremist content, as well as gaming and gambling websites or applications, will all be restricted. We will also disable the device from a certain time at night so that students do not spend excessive amounts of time on their devices at home.<br><br>

The DMA would allow the school to remotely download appropriate teaching and learning applications, as well as security patches, into every student’s device. In addition, the DMA comes with classroom management capabilities to assist teachers in actively monitoring and controlling the students’ screens during lesson time, for better student management and effective teaching.<br><br>

Parents will be informed of the activation of Parent's DMA portal and choice of DMA options which will give parents different levels of control over their child's device after school hours (6 pm to 7 am the following day)<br><br>

In addition, through CCE lessons, students will be taught how to embrace the convenience of technology while maintaining a balanced lifestyle between online and offline activities, and to be a safe and responsible user of technology.<br><br>

<b>8. How will the school help my child to manage possible cyber risks and cyber addiction?</b><br><br>

As part of our school’s Cyber Wellness education, students learn how to take responsibility for their online well-being, and how to be positive role models to others in creating safe and kind online communities. The revised CCE 2021 will also feature cyber wellness education more strongly, with updated authentic scenarios used, to better equip students to navigate online spaces safely and help develop a more supportive cyber environment.

A very warm welcome to you and your child!<br><br>

All parents are automatically members of the Zhenghua Secondary School Parent Support Group (ZSS PSG). The ZSS PSG is a network of parents who work in close partnership with the school.<br><br>

We are currently inviting interested parents to sign up for the following:<br><br>

<b>1) Class WhatsApp Chatgroup (for Parents)</b><br><br>

As parents, you may be concerned about your child’s studies and would like to keep yourself abreast of the upcoming school programmes and activities. The ZSS PSG will be forming WhatsApp chatgroup for each of the Secondary One classes as a platform to provide parents from the same class an avenue to receive information from the school and the PSG.<br><br>

<b>2) As active PSG members</b><br><br>

We are also inviting interested parents to join us as active PSG members. As active PSG members, you get to help out in school events and lend support for PSG activities. By joining the PSG as active parent volunteers, you will also gain support from other parents in your parenting journey.<br><br>

<b>3) Transition to Secondary School Life Parenting Workshop and PSG Welcome [4 February 2023, 10:00am-11.30am]</b><br><br>

Students tend to face a host of emotional and psychological challenges as they transit from primary school to secondary school. While this journey into secondary school can be exciting, some teenagers will require time to adjust and accommodate to the new environment.<br><br>

To help parents understand the importance of parental support during this transitional phase of your child, ZSS PSG will be organizing the following parenting workshop in January:<br><br>

Transition to Secondary School Life Parenting Workshop and PSG Welcome<br><br>

Date: 4 February 2023, Saturday<br>

Time: 10am-11.30am<br>

Venue: School Library<br>

Through the workshop, parents can learn to:<br><br>

1.  Understand the different expectations and developmental tasks that your child may encounter during this period of time.<br>
2.  Be equipped with the necessary knowledge to support your child in the secondary school learning environment and help him/her to understand how better to overcome the various challenges in secondary school.<br>

As part of our efforts to go green, all registrations for PSG will be done online. Please take a moment to go to the link below for the registration form for the three programmes stated above. Alternatively, you may scan the QR code for the registration form. Please allow us seven working days to process your registration.<br><br>

<b>2.&nbsp;My child wants to enter this school but was not offered a place. How can I appeal for a place?</b><br><br>

You can register your appeal by submitting the online form linked in Section 4 of this Microsite. In the event there is a vacancy and your child meets our school's cut-off point, we will contact you as soon as we can.<br><br>

<b>3.&nbsp; Can I appeal if my child does not meet the cut-off point?</b><br><br>

You can still register your appeal by submitting the online form linked in Section 4 of this Microsite. However, we are unlikely to take in students below the cut-off point as school admissions are based on merit. In the MOE Secondary One (S1) Posting Exercise, posting decisions are based on objective and transparent measures of academic merit, i.e. PSLE scores. Appeals that take place after the S1 Posting Exercise must be aligned to these principles, in order to be fair to the other admitted students.&nbsp; Students who would like to gain admission to a secondary school on the basis of other talents and achievements, e.g. those in sports or arts, already have the option of an alternative admissions pathway in the form of the Direct School Admissions Exercise.<br><br>

<b>4.&nbsp; Besides the usual academic pursuits, what are other programmes the school have to stretch the potential of the students to a higher level?</b><br><br>

Annually, we send students for all sorts of competitions and workshops beyond the school. Subject specific ones include Math and Science Olympiads, EL Debating and oratorical competitions, MTL oratorical and creative writing workshops, Humanities Talent Development Programmes. Beyond specific subject areas, we also identify students to be in our Stretch Programme, where they are trained to debate on contemporary issues, solve future problems, and come up with creative solutions. You can read up more on the many awards that our students have received over the years on our website: /student-achievements/<br><br>

<b>5.&nbsp; How is the school going to provide assistance for academically weaker students?</b><br><br>

Students who need extra help can seek our their subject teachers for after school consultation.&nbsp; We also have after school remedial lessons to help those who need that extra academic guidance.<br><br>

<b>6.&nbsp; What is the discipline culture of the school?</b><br><br>

Zhenghua is well known in Bukit Panjang for our positive and caring school culture. All our teachers play a crucial role in ensuring a strong discipline in Zhenghua through the restorative approach, working together towards developing all our students into self-disciplined and responsible students of integrity.<br><br>

<b>7.&nbsp; How many of your canteen stalls are Halal? Do your school cater to students who are on vegetarian diet?</b><br><br>

We have 8 canteen stalls comprising 6 cooked food stalls, 1 cold drinks and cut fruit stall, and 1 hot drinks and snack stall.&nbsp; Out of the 6 cooked food stalls, 3 are halal certified. Our hot drinks and snack stall also only sells halal certified snacks such as sandwiches, buns, biscuits, cakes. We unfortunately do not have a fully vegetarian stall, but the cooked food stalls do serve purely vegetarian dishes.<br><br>

<b>8.&nbsp; What is the school’s stand on outside tuition?</b><br><br>

We do not recommend our students to go for tuition except for exceptional cases, e.g. international student struggling with English.&nbsp; The students should instead approach their teachers for help.&nbsp; We also put in place several remedial measures for all our students to succeed.<br><br>

<b>9.&nbsp; Are mobile phones allowed in the school? What can the school do to prevent excessive mobile phone usage? Why does the school not ban mobile phone use in school?</b><br><br>

Mobile phones are not allowed to be used during curriculum time and will have to be kept in the student’s locker during lesson time. Phones will be confiscated by teachers when misused. Students are only allowed to use their phones before school, during recess and after school.<br><br>

<b>10.&nbsp; Who can opt for Higher MTL and where are the lessons held?</b><br><br>

For your child to take HMTL, your child should meet the following criteria:<br><br>

(i) An overall PSLE Score of 8 or better<br><br>

OR<br><br>

(ii) An overall PSLE Score of 9 to 14 (inclusive); and attain AL 1 / AL 2 in MTL or Distinction / Merit in HMTL.<br><br>

Students eligible for HMTL will be invited to apply for these programmes immediately after the release of the PSLE results.<br><br>

HML courses will be held in Bukit Panjang Government High, outside curriculum time and HCL courses will held in our school.<br><br>

<b>11.&nbsp; My child does not meet the above criteria to offer HMTL, can my child still opt for HMTL in Secondary School?</b><br><br>

The school has the flexibility to allow students who do not meet the above criteria to offer HMTL, if they are assessed to have exceptional ability in MTL and are able to do HMTL without affecting their performance in other subjects.<br><br>

Based on students’ performance in the various weighted assessments throughout the year, teachers will be able to have a good gauge of their progress. Students who obtain a grade of A2 and above in MTL in Semester 1 with an overall average of 60 will be offered HCL in semester 2 in secondary one in our school.<br><br>

At the end of year examination in secondary two, students who have shown keen interest and have exceptional ability in MTL will be invited to take a diagnostic test to gauge their ability to cope with the higher level subject. They will then be offered HMTL in secondary three.<br><br>

<b>12.&nbsp; My child is taking Tamil language. When and where are the classes held?</b><br><br>

Students who are offered Tamil will study at the Tamil Language Centre, Chua Chu Kang Secondary School outside curriculum time. &nbsp;The current 2023 schedule is as follows:<br><br>
