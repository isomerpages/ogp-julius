### **Student Leadership**
Here at YIJC, the Student Leadership Programme enhances leadership learning and further develops leadership competencies for all our students. The programme prepares every YIJC-ian to be responsible students of the College and responsible future citizens of our society.

Adopting a structured leadership developmental approach of Assignments-Relationships-Courses (A-R-C), the programme aims to develop student leaders in the domains of **Intellectual Capacity, Teamwork** and **Drive** .

**Courses** on leadership theories and philosophies provide deep understanding of leaders and leadership. Leadership **Assignments** offer hands-on opportunities to develop leadership competencies through programmes and activities. Students are also developed holistically through mentoring and guidance from their teachers. Along with cultivating a habit of deep reflection about their assignments, the student leadership experience here at YIJC creates positive **Relationships** that allow for more effective leadership development.

#### **Key Student Leadership Platforms**
Student leaders are provided first-hand experience at planning, implementing, evaluating, and reviewing key College events. Student leaders from the Students’ Council, Class Leaders Council, and different CCA groups collaborate to organise student-led College events and strive to generate a strong and positive College spirit within the YIJC community.

Students are also given opportunities to take the lead in Academic and Character & Citizenship Education (CCE) Councils to support the joy of learning. In these positions, they spearhead student-led learning experiences for their peers. 

Students are also given the autonomy to form Interest Groups with like-minded peers who share a common passion to contribute to positive school experiences.
